job_seq: 
    Uniquely identifies a job record (47350 unique values)

action_taken_code: Action taken by sailor due to failure of malfunction of equipment
    ~95% of observed entries are 1,3,4,2
    In dec. order of freuqnecy

    1: Maintenance action completed; parts drawn from supply
    Open_job: Created myself. action_taken_code and action_taken are NA when a job was never closed. 
    3: Maintenance action completed; no parts required
    4: Cancelled (deferral will be removed from the CSMP)
    2: Maintenance action completed; parts not from supply
    0: None of the above (describe in remarks)
    2B: Completed; parts not from supply; was necessary

date_closing: Ranging from 11/1/2017 to 6/16/2022
    ~11k NAs. Believed to be unfinished jobs at the time the maintenance data stopped being updated

Note to self - One possible idea could be to fit 2 models. One with a time sequential train/test split and another split randomly to see if this influences performance. 

deferral_reason_code: 
Identifies the reason for deferring the maintenance action [Percentage of recorded entries for this column]
    0: OTHER/ NA [14%]

eic: Equipment Identification Code
    7 character code. *Not available in appendix
    1: system
    2: subsystem
    3 and 4: equipment category in system 
    - Last 3 digits: Greater detail

    ~ Half are 'Vent nonmch Prp'

eswbs_opening: Expanded Ship Work Breakdown Structure (ESWBS) reported by the ships force during the opening of the Deferral or Non Deferral. 
 *eswbs_opening and eswbs_closing are almost always the same. eswbs_closing is not recorded for Unfinished jobs
| 21 distinct values for eswbs_opening
| First 3 identify the section of the MIL-STD-1399
Last 2 distinguish sections relatedd to the same primary ESWBS element in case of subject duplication; however, around 85% end with "11".
512: 60%
514: 20%
433: 7%
513: 7%
436: 3%
511: 2%

identification_number_closing: The ID/EQUIPMENT SERIAL NUMBER of the equipment reported at the closing of the Deferral MA. 
    - Non-Deferral/IMA MAs will be "NULL".
    Does not uniquely identify equipment. Filtered to include with value '12AF. Gave results on different ships and in different locations. 

jcn: uic (ship identifier) + work center + job sequence number 
    First 5 digits - UIC. Next 4 digits - Cognizant Work Center. Last 4 digits - Job Sequence Number

location: 
    1: level (up/down relative to main deck)
        #1,2,3,4.... refers to levels below the main deck (so, level 7 is lower on the ship than level 1)
        #01,02,03.... refers to levels above the main deck (so, level 05 is higher on the ship than level 01)

        #03 refers to the flight deck, which accounts for the highest proprtion of HVAC records
        #1 refers to the Main Deck



    2: front of the ship (bow) to the back of the ship (stern). [Frame Number] 
        #Frame number increases as you go towards the back of the ship. 
        #Spaced approximately 4 feet apart, which is why there are so many frame number values. 


    3: distance from center line parallel to the ship in terms of compartment (even: left, odd: right)
        0 is the centerline 
        Odd numbers: Compartments located to the starboard (right side facing forward)
        Even numbers: Compartments located to the port (left side facing forward)
        Horizontal. Example: 2-100-5-Q would mean it is located in the 3rd compartment to the right of the centerline
        How big are these compartments? Compartment sizes vary, but are generally said to be 10-20 feet wide. 

*Note to self: The number of levels can vary from ship to ship. So, analysis on the 'top level' of the ship will need to be more cautious than simply looking at entires with the largest level number in the dataset. 
For later, look into the unique values of Level, Frame Number, Distance From Center, 
Also, look at whether all location codes have the same purpose. Specifically, is it possible for 2-100-3-A and 2-100-3-B to exist? 

    4: purpose (Q,L,M) Machine Area, Living Area, Engineering Rooms, etc.
        A     Supply and stowage
        AA   Cargo holds 
        C     Control centers (such as the combat information center) 
        E     Engineering (machinery) 
        F     Fuel stowage (for use by the ship; that is, not as cargo) 
        FF   Fuel stowage compartments (when cargo)

Supply Dataset Columns 

Columns also present in jobs: jcn, uic, work_center, date_maintenace_action, date_closing, **issue_apl, issue_eic**
jcn: last 4 digits comes from jsn, this column does not exist in Jobs

document_number: Unique value, can specifically identify a part order.

request_num: Often identical or near identical (1 letter difference) to document_number. Also unique values

requisition_number: Similar to document_number. All 3 of these can likely be removed. 

demand_date: 
    Date maintenance personnel (SF/IMA) requested parts/material from Supply to perform maintenance
    Date the parts were requested ranging from 11/1/2017 to 12/4/2022

Note on Dates: 
#47350 in jobs (11233 do not have a closing value), 35194 in supply (849 do not have a closing value)
47350 (rows in jobs) - 11233 (closing is NA in jobs) - 35194 (rows in supply) - supply_data['date_closing'].isnull().sum() = 74
Looks like supply is almost all closed maintenance, while jobs contains some unfinished maintenance records

issue_date: Date Supply Dept personnel (SF/IMA) issued parts/material to maintenance personnel to fix the
    equipment (APL, EIC, ESWBS) reported on 2K and/or AWR. 
    ISSUE minus DEMAND DATE for "a matching item" is DAYS AWAITING PARTS. (COULD BE VERY USEFUL)
    Date the maintenance personnel were supplied the parts from the Supply Dept Personnel 
    11/3/7017 - 12/9/2022
    Note: possible outliers/ incorrect entry: 4 observations have issue dates of 10/30/1992. Also, another 7 entries are in 2017 before 11/1. 
    issue date should be at least the day of the demand date, if not later. 
    The first demand date is 11/1/2017


cwt_hours: Hours elapsed between the order or demand date and the received or issue date. 
    issue_date - demand_date 
    Contains some negative values, represents issue_date coming before demand_date. 
    22893 are positive. Negative values occur when demand_date is after issue_date

niin: 9 digit number identfying the part being ordered.
    Niin will uniquely identify niin_nomenclature, but the inverse is not true. 
    Question for later - niin 15040653, 15040647, 15040643, 15040657, 15017411, 15017405 each correspond to Filter Element, Air. Are there any notable differences between these niin's? 
    There is a similar trend for many niin_nomenclature values


niin_nomenclature:
    Most common entries 
    Filter element, air [35%]
    O-Ring [4%]
    Belt, V [4%]
    Bearing, Ball, annula [3%]
    Gasket [2%]

unit_of_issue:A dual alphabetic abbreviation for the unit of issue of the item issued by Supply to maintenance personnel. 91% are EA.

supply_pri: Categorical variable w 4 levels. Almost all = 4

source_code: 
    61% are A. 8 unique values.  Identifies basis of supply item availability when item requested


quantity: Integer from 1 to 2532, some outliers that will need to be handled. Median = 1

unit_price: Individual price of each supply item

total_price = quantity * unit_price





Look at differences in supply orders for different work centers, types of jobs, etc.
