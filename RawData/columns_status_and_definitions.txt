----Supply Data Column Definitions----

jcn: A number used to identify each repair alteration action reported in the 3-M (Maintenance and Material
    Management) System. It is structured to show the activity unit identification code, originating workcenter, and the job sequence number. 
    Note: First 5 digits - UIC. Next 4 digits - Cognizant Work Center.
    Last 4 digits - Job Sequence Number.

uic: Unit Identification Code - 5 digit accounting NR for a ship, shore activity or contractor assigned
    by military services for accounting purposes. UIC & ACTIVITY NAMES are listed in NAVCOMPT
    Manual Vol. 2 Chap 5. 
    identifies the activity that originated the availability
    11 distinct uic

work_center: WORK CENTER of the ship/shore activity being 'tended' by the REPAIR UIC. Although uncommon a 3 POS WORK CENTER can be 'tended' by a REPAIR UIC. 
    A subcomponent of organization. It may be a department, division, work center or some other component type code.
    The subdivision of the SF crew. 
    Each work_center is present on several other ships. 
    Some work centers (ex: EA03) exist on all 11 ships
    196 unique values

jsn: A sequential number assigned to each maintenance action within a Work Center. job sequence number
    The sequential number assigned to a job representing its relative creation point with other jobs
    manifested within a given work center.
    A four-character number assigned by the work center to the maintenance action, or assigned by the outside activity performing the work. 
    This assigned sequentially from the Ship’s Force Work List/ Job Sequence Number Log.
    (last 4 of the jcn)
    2094 unique values
    Grouping by uic, jcn and jsn have the same amount of unique values for each ship

date_maintenance_action: Date MA is NSLC created. It controls FROM/TO windows for extracting MAs.For        
    most part, Date MA is not O/P. Date MA creation is dependent on TYPE MA: D/I use Date open; N, Date close; R/P Demand/Issue date; T, MRMS Date.
    Ranges from to 11/1/2017 to 5/31/2022 (same range as jobs_data)
    pd.to_datetime(supply_data['date_maintenance_action']).sort_values().min()

date_closing: Date Deferral (D), Non-deferral (N) or IMA (I) MA was closed. Demand only, Part only, & Narrative
    only MAs (MA TYPES R, P, T respectively) will be "NULL". NULL Dates are O/P as 0's. Open/Close
    dates for "N" MA's are =, unless one is NULL.
    Ranges from 11/1/2017 to 12/14/2022 (11/12017 to 6/16/2022 for jobs_data)
    948 NA values   
Note on Dates: 
For the jobs dataset, the last recorded date_closing is 


document_number: 31950 unique values (NOT IMPORTANT)

request_num: This will hold the requisition number used on the 1348 or message to order the part from some stock
    point off of the ship. (31983 unique values) (NOT IMPORTANT)

requisition_number: Document number used to order part. The requisition number contains a six-character activity UIC (NOT USEFUL)

demand_date: Date maintenance personnel (SF/IMA) requested parts/material from Supply to perform maintenance
    vice stocking storerooms.
    Date the parts were requested
    Ranging from 11/1/2017 to 12/4/2022

Note on Dates: 
#47350 in jobs (11233 do not have a closing value), 35194 in supply (849 do not have a closing value)
47350 (rows in jobs) - 11233 (closing is NA in jobs) - 35194 (rows in supply) - supply_data['date_closing'].isnull().sum() = 74
Looks like supply is almost all closed maintenance, while jobs contains some unfinished maintenance records

issue_date: Date Supply Dept personnel (SF/IMA) issued parts/material to maintenance personnel to fix the
    equipment (APL, EIC, ESWBS) reported on 2K and/or AWR. 
    ISSUE minus DEMAND DATE for "a matching item" is DAYS AWAITING PARTS. (COULD BE VERY USEFUL)
    Date the maintenance personnel were supplied the parts from the Supply Dept Personnel 
    11/3/7017 - 12/9/2022
    Note: possible outliers/ incorrect entry: 4 observations have issue dates of 10/30/1992. Also, another 7 entries are in 2017 before 11/1. 
    issue date should be at least the day of the demand date, if not later. 
    The first demand date is 11/1/2017

cwt_hours: Hours elapsed between the order or demand date and the received or issue date. 
    Feature engineered from issue_date - demand_date. 
    Contains some negative values, represents issue_date coming before demand_date. 
    22893 are positive. Negative values occur when demand_date is after issue_date

issue_apl: Allowance Parts List - a SUP/MAINT NR/DOC for equipments on ships; created by NAVICP.
    Contains data on ship's equipment; i.e., characteristics, parts (NIIN) needed & QTY thereof

issue_eic: EIC-7 character code, 1st position identifies system; 2nd identifies subsystem; & 3rd & 4th identify
    equip category in system. Remaining 3 digits provide greater detail

niin: National Item Identification Number-9 digit NR, first 2 digits are the National Codification Bureau (NCB) code. The 9 digit NR uniquely identifies each National Stock Number (NSN) item in the Federal Supply System.
    Each niin corresponds to 1 niin_nomenclature value. For example, 16945741 corresponds to BELT,V both times it is seen in the dataset. 
    However, each niin_nomenclature value does not correspond to the same niin value. For example, BELT,V is seen 1015 times, with 21 distinct values for niin when subsetting the dataset to 
    only include rows with niin_nomenclature = 'BELT,V'
    Summary: Multiple niin numbers match to a shared niin_nomenclature description

niin_nomenclature: 873 unique values

quantity: quantity of supplies. 

unit of issue: A dual alphabetic abbreviation for the unit of issue of the item issued by Supply to maintenance personnel. Compliments Issue QUANTITY; i.e.,EA, DZ, CK. 91% are EA. 

supply_pri: Vast majority = 4. Categorical variable with possible values 1,2,3,4

source_code: A 1-digit A/N code per NAVSUP PUB 485. Identifies basis of supply item availability when item requested; i.e., IS, NIS, LISTED but NC or NC. Paired with FUND CODE 2nd POS for computing "ALLOWANCE EFFECTIVENESS". 
        61% are A. 8 unique values

unit_price: price of each supply unit

total_price: quantity * unit_price

job_seq: A sequential number assigned to each Maintenance Action.
