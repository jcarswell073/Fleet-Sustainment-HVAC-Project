    Configuration of the ship. Describes changes from the design of the ship to the final build. It is an identifier for that subsystem or system at that point in time.

csmp_narrative_summary: Condensed description of the problem, limited to 30 characters

    ~11k NAs. Believed to be unfinished jobs at the time the maintenance data stopped being updated

Note to self - One possible idea could be to fit 2 models. One with a time sequential train/test split and another split randomly to see if this influences performance. 

deferral_reason_code: 
Identifies the reason for deferring the maintenance action [Percentage of recorded entries for this column]
    0: OTHER/ NA [14%]

    ~ Half are 'Vent nonmch Prp'

eswbs_opening: Expanded Ship Work Breakdown Structure (ESWBS) reported by the ships force during the opening of the Deferral or Non Deferral. 
 *eswbs_opening and eswbs_closing are almost always the same. eswbs_closing is not recorded for Unfinished jobs
| 21 distinct values for eswbs_opening
| First 3 identify the section of the MIL-STD-1399
Last 2 distinguish sections relatedd to the same primary ESWBS element in case of subject duplication; however, around 85% end with "11".
512: 60%
514: 20%
433: 7%
513: 7%
436: 3%
511: 2%

identification_number_closing: The ID/EQUIPMENT SERIAL NUMBER of the equipment reported at the closing of the Deferral MA. 
    - Non-Deferral/IMA MAs will be "NULL".
    Does not uniquely identify equipment. Filtered to include with value '12AF. Gave results on different ships and in different locations. 

jcn: uic (ship identifier) + work center + job sequence number 
    First 5 digits - UIC. Next 4 digits - Cognizant Work Center. Last 4 digits - Job Sequence Number

location: 
    1: level (up/down relative to main deck)
        #1,2,3,4.... refers to levels below the main deck (so, level 7 is lower on the ship than level 1)
        #01,02,03.... refers to levels above the main deck (so, level 05 is higher on the ship than level 01)

        #03 refers to the flight deck, which accounts for the highest proprtion of HVAC records
        #1 refers to the Main Deck



    2: front of the ship (bow) to the back of the ship (stern). [Frame Number] 
        #Frame number increases as you go towards the back of the ship. 
        #Spaced approximately 4 feet apart, which is why there are so many frame number values. 


    3: distance from center line parallel to the ship in terms of compartment (even: left, odd: right)
        0 is the centerline 
        Odd numbers: Compartments located to the starboard (right side facing forward)
        Even numbers: Compartments located to the port (left side facing forward)
        Horizontal. Example: 2-100-5-Q would mean it is located in the 3rd compartment to the right of the centerline
        How big are these compartments? Compartment sizes vary, but are generally said to be 10-20 feet wide. 

*Note to self: The number of levels can vary from ship to ship. So, analysis on the 'top level' of the ship will need to be more cautious than simply looking at entires with the largest level number in the dataset. 
For later, look into the unique values of Level, Frame Number, Distance From Center, 
Also, look at whether all location codes have the same purpose. Specifically, is it possible for 2-100-3-A and 2-100-3-B to exist? 

    4: purpose (Q,L,M) Machine Area, Living Area, Engineering Rooms, etc.
        A     Supply and stowage
        AA   Cargo holds 
        C     Control centers (such as the combat information center) 
        E     Engineering (machinery) 
        F     Fuel stowage (for use by the ship; that is, not as cargo) 
        FF   Fuel stowage compartments (when cargo) 
        J     Jet (aviation) fuel for use by embarked aircraft 
        JJ    Jet (aviation) fuel as cargo 
        K    Chemicals and dangerous materials
        L     Living spaces
        M    Ammunition spaces
