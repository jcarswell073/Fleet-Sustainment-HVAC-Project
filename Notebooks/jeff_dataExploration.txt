cdm_rin:
All but 16 records have length 5
Configuration of the ship. Describes changes from the design of the ship to the final build. It is an identifier for that subsystem or system at that point in time.

csmp_narrative_summary: Condensed description of the problem, limited to 30 characters

date_maintenace_action: Ranging from 11/1/2017 to 5/31/2022

date_closing: Ranging from 11/1/2017 to 6/16/2022
~11k NAs. Believed to be unfinished jobs at the time the maintenance data stopped being updated
Note to self - One possible idea could be to fit 2 models. One with a time sequential train/test split and another split randomly to see if this influences performance. 

deferral_reason_code: 
Identifies the reason for deferring the maintenance action [Percentage of recorded entries for this column]
    0: OTHER/ NA [14%]
    1: Due to ship's force work backlog/ operational priority [24%]

    3: No formal training for this equipment 
    4: Formal training inadequate for this equipment
    5: Inadequate school practical training
    6: Lack of facilities/ capabilities [13%]
    7: Not authorized for ship's force accomplishment
    8: For ship's force overhaul or availability work list [10%]
    9: Lack of technical documentation

due_date:
The latest possible day for completion of the maintenance action received by ships force. Reported or deferral only.

7 character code. *Not available in appendix
    1: system
    2: subsystem
    3 and 4: equipment category in system 
    - Last 3 digits: Greater detail

equipment_nomenclature: Description of the equipment as reported by the person involved in the Maintenance Action. 
~ Half are 'Vent nonmch Prp'

eswbs_opening: Expanded Ship Work Breakdown Structure (ESWBS) reported by the ships force during the opening of the Deferral or Non Deferral. 
 *eswbs_opening and eswbs_closing are almost always the same. eswbs_closing is not recorded for Unfinished jobs
| 21 distinct values for eswbs_opening
| First 3 identify the section of the MIL-STD-1399
Last 2 distinguish sections relatedd to the same primary ESWBS element in case of subject duplication; however, around 85% end with "11".
512: 60%
514: 20%
433: 7%
513: 7%
436: 3%
511: 2%

identification_number_closing: The ID/EQUIPMENT SERIAL NUMBER of the equipment reported at the closing of the Deferral MA. 
    - Non-Deferral/IMA MAs will be "NULL".
Does not uniquely identify equipment. Filtered to include with value '12AF. Gave results on different ships and in different locations. 

jcn: uic (ship identifier) + work center + job sequence number 
First 5 digits - UIC. Next 4 digits - Cognizant Work Center. Last 4 digits - Job Sequence Number

location: 
    1: level (up/down relative to main deck)
    2: front of the ship to the back of the ship
    3: distance from center line parallel to the ship (even: left, odd: right)
    4: purpose (Q,L,M) Machine Area, Living Area, Engineering Rooms, etc.

Location Frequencies- 
Front of the ship to the back of the ship: 
No spot has more than 5% of observed records.
Wide distribution of maintenance reports. 

mhc - man hours closing
    total man-hours expended by all ship's force personnel involved in the defferal closing or non defferal MA

mho - man hours opening
    total man-hours expended by all sf personnel involved in the deferral action up to the time of defferal

mhr - man hours remaining
    the estimated number of ship's force man-hours remianing to complete the deferred maintainance action

priority_code:
the precendence of the deferred maintenance action
    1 - MANDATORY
    2 - ESSENTIAL
    3 - HIGHLY DESIRABLE
    4 - DESIRABLE (99% of Jobs are Desireable)

safety_code: Filled values represent some form of perceived safety risk. 90/10% split with most having no safety risk

status_code - condition of the equipment at time when_discovered 
    many engineering users consider MAs with STATUS CODE 2/3 to be 'failures' and use for R M and A computations/analysis
    1 - OPERATIONAL [47%]
    2 - NON-OPERATIONAL [14%]
    3 - REDUCED CAPABILITY [21%]
    0 - NOT APPLICABLE (TO BE USED WHEN REPORTING PRINTING SERVICES, ETC.) [18%]
